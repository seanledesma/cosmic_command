Final project done in collaboration with PeppersOnlyPizza for our Data Structures and Algorithms class.

Currently working on an executable .jar, but for now if you are interested in running this you will have to set up JavaFX in an IDE (preferably Eclipse)
and import all the files into a project. Very janky way, and not recommended. Until there is a .jar file, you may watch our presentation on the project
with the youtube link below.
